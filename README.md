# README for Zach's Portfolio Page
## Description
Hello & welcome to my portfolio. This is a mix of both CSS & HTML coding to build a modestly interactive site to display current (and future) projects.
Please do note that for projects that we have not yet started, I have linked in empty GitHub repositories, in order to fully adhere to the standards of Challenge 2. 
Similarly, for my Resume, I linked to my Linkedin page as opposed to creating a shell.
## Credit
I did utilize the UNC Tutor system for assistance with further understanding CSS, so credit must be given to my tutor, Samuel Cordova, without whom I would have been quite lost.
I also utilized resources found on W3 and StackedOverflow in order to further understand concepts, though I did not copy any code found in those resources. 
Thank you for taking the time to read!
